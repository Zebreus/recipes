# Flautas

## Zutaten

6-10 taco-size tortillas, corn or flour (I prefer ultra-thin corn for this)
1 15.5 oz (439g) can of beans (I use black or kidney)
1 4 oz (113g) can of diced green chilies
4 oz (113g) smooth-melting cheese (I use Monterey Jack)
cumin
dried oregano
garlic powder
salt
olive oil
water and cornstarch (if using corn tortillas)

## Rezept

Rinse and drain the beans. Dump in the chilies, and tear in the cheese in chunks. Season with cumin, oregano, garlic powder and salt to taste. Squish a few hands-full of the beans into paste, then mix everything throughly. Be sure to taste for seasoning — some canned beans are much saltier than others.

If using corn tortillas, wrap them in a damp towel and heat them until warm to make them more pliable — I use the microwave. Also if using corn, dissolve a dash of cornstarch in a little water and heat it until boiling and gelatinized to use as a glue.

Position a log of filling onto the middle of each tortilla, then use your finger to smear the cornstarch glue onto the edge of the tortilla that will form the outer seal — plain water is fine if you're using flour tortillas. Roll each tortilla up tight with the seal positioned on the bottom.

An a wide pan or griddle, heat a film of olive oil over medium-low heat. Put in each of the flautas seam-side down, and mop each one around in the oil to make sure the bottom is coated. You might need to slide the flautas around as they cook so they each brown evenly. When the first side is golden and crispy, flip them all and repeat. With flour tortillas I usually try to brown a third side, but corn tortillas are usually too delicate to lay on their sides.

When everything is golden and the filling is hot and melty, you're done. Serve with your choice of one of the condiments below.
